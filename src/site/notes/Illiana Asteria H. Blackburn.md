## The Innocence of Age

  $\quad$ It was late into the night of the 1st of September 2357, 26:44pm local time in New Havana, when the next sovereign of the Imperium was born. 

$\quad$ Illiana Asteria H. Blackburn was born a healthy baby and would be as such for much of her childhood. It was a manifest of her genetic inheritance that she only contracted a fever when she was 5 years old. 

$\quad$ She would inherit many more traits from her parents. From her mother, the [Heir Imperial](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Princess-Admiral&file=Aurelia%20K.%20Blackburn), Illiana would take after her in hair and eye color, facial structure and skin tone among others. As for her father, the [Prince Imperial](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Princess-Admiral&file=Geoffery%20Nakamura%20H.%20Blackburn), she would most notably attain his height and strength.

$\quad$ Arguably however, the most important trait she gained was Aurelia’s appetite for learning and the related capacity to use what knowledge she was given.

$\quad$ Indeed, by the age of 3, Illiana either had an idea or had mastered the alphabet, basic sentences, the concept of addition and subtraction, and the fact she was destined to be ruler of the Imperium.

$\quad$ She was also encouraged to ask questions about anything she saw that interested her with answers routinely provided by Aurelia. It would get to the point it would become one of their main bonding activities; Illiana would be sat beside or on Aurelia's lap and the princess would go about explaining a piece of technology or a societal concept.

$\quad$ Illiana’s relationship with both her parents during this time would be memorable overall, the three of them spending much of their time together. This was in spite of their work as Illiana was usually brought along with them to work. 

$\quad$ This period of bliss was brutally ended during the 22nd of March, 2362.

$\quad$ She was accompanying her mother and her grandfather — Francis Blackburn, then Emperor of the Imperium — on a tour of the imperial border systems. These star systems had been given a greater importance in recent years due to Francis’ policy of rejuvenation for the wider Imperial economy. This policy however, in spite of its widespread success, did garner substantial backlash from large corporations who were profiting from them being the primary source of goods and services in those systems.

$\quad$ One of these corporations was Hydel Heavy Construction which took a significant dive in its shares after other companies started flooding the border systems. This lead them to eventually filing for bankruptcy and then closure in 2359. The CEO of HHC would then take to radicalization following one too many nights of drinking, becoming a voice of opposition to the “mass exploitation of the rim territories”. So much so, he would form the Party for the Liberation of the Rim (PLR). 

$\quad$ Simmering tensions would result in the violent assassination of Emperor Francis during his visit to Cirassia. 

$\quad$ An assassination that saw the streets of Cirassia’s capital city strewn with burning bodies, and charred vehicles, and the sovereign killed with intention since Emperor Kaneshiro Mizuho in 2276. 

$\quad$ This would also begin Illiana’s path to ascension for she was made Heir Imperial after her mother’s hastened coronation two days after. It would also begin one of the darker phases of her life, one she would nearly not survive.

## The Lilac Mantle

$\quad$ Terra was different from Freya in many ways — capital of a star system versus capital of the Imperium made that distinction clear — and in nowhere else was this more evident in the difference between the Blackburn Royal House outside of New Havana and the Imperial Palace. 

$\quad$ Illiana touched down at the Royal Singapura Naval Yard at the start of April, a few days after Aurelia. Her royal conditioning and training as Heir Imperial would begin very shortly thereafter, jumpstarted by the prevailing fear being that the new Empress could be on a still ongoing hitlist.

$\quad$ Therefore, as she turned 5 on the 1st of September, 2362, Illiana was already a changed person. One already beginning to feel the strain of the weight placed upon her shoulders.

$\quad$ She wasn’t subjected to the intensive lessons Aurelia had gone through just yet. Her training had kicked off quickly but it hadn’t started with direct tutelage. Instead, after introductory level teaching, she would attend the winter convention of the Imperial Assembly in October until its conclusion in January.

$\quad$ Illiana was usually with her mother when she attended the major sessions, sat on her lap and given hushed explanations as to what was happening. She would become somewhat of a national sensation in this setup, regarded as reminder of humanity in the Imperial government. For the other sessions where Aurelia didn’t attend or had a major part in the proceedings, Illiana joined her mentor, Duke Alfred Santiago who was also the Governor of Terra at the time. 

$\quad$ This arrangement would persist until she was 7 years old. She would get much experience from this, the memories of which would help her later on. Illiana didn’t get the deeper principles, but she did understand the basics of governance, which was more than enough for her age. 

$\quad$ She would also come to remember this time as the last of the happy times at home. When neither parent had been swamped with work and thus had time to spend with her nor were there especially high expectations for what she had to do. This tempo would be irrevocably changed some time after she turned 8.

## Black Beneath Gold

$\quad$ When the rearmament of the Holy Solar Empire became widespread knowledge to the imperial populace, the panic was palpable. Imperial intelligence had been keeping track of the program since it began and had assessed Aperran strength as only near-peer. The “Stellar Consolidation” saw every corner of the Aperran realm brought above Kal’Tenir. Imperial media agencies had been invited to view the event and so the revitalized might of the HSE was put on full display for the Imperium to see.

$\quad$ The ensuing whirlwind of activity saw Aurelia (and the wider government) hash out a declaration that would provide the Imperial military the means to modernize. For 60 days did the government and military sit down in back-to-back sessions to finalize the extent, timeline, and mostly importantly the budget, that the ITAF would need. 


## Athena’s Blessings


## Assured Ascension 


## Toward the Rim


## Wielded Fury

$\quad$ When Illiana was given command of the 13th Fleet, not much was expected of the formation. This wasn’t for any negative reason, but the simple fact was that the 13th — much like the other formations in the first wave of activated reserve fleets — was mainly meant to hold the line until more, better, units could be brought forth.

$\quad$ The fleet had state of the art vessels like the *L’Orient* and *Cerulean Sky* to more antiquated ships like the *Inconstant* and *Nisshin*. Nevertheless Illiana made do with what she was given. Her efforts were helped by the clout she held in the Admiralty, especially after her independent commands, and her stint as head of the Sirius Instructional Command.

$\quad$ Thus, while Illiana took a mixed-bag in terms of equipment, she also took a well-trained, battle ready, set of crews with her into one of her most decisive and famous operations of the war.

$\quad$ **[[Operation Winter Solstice\|Operation Winter Solstice]]**.

$\quad$ Regarded as a masterpiece in planning and execution, Winter Solstice would pave a burning path through the systems of Athena, Demeter, and ending in Gothica. Imperial casualties would be relatively light compared to previous campaigns, the 13th Fleet for instance would still retain approximately 78% combat strength at the resolution of the operation. Battlefleet Lacaille and the 17th Reserve Fleet would finish with an even larger percentage of combat-ready vessels. The ground theater had been resolved even faster due to the joint efforts of the Imperial Naval Infantry, Army, and Council of Seers. 

$\quad$ Illiana’s campaign would be one gifted with success. From her destruction of 3 Aperran fleets — caught flat-footed at their forward base of Harbinger-8 — which essentially conceded Athena back to the Imperium, and the lightning battles fought for the liberation of the system’s planets. Then the complete retaking of Demeter not more than a week and a half after Athena had been declared returned to the Imperial fold. The culminating event would be the dance above Rydan, a Manufacturing planet in Gothica, where the 13th Fleet would perform an intrinsic ballet with the Aperran Fleet of Cystalis. The 2-day battle would see quick, but fierce actions fought in the orbit and upper atmosphere of the planet. Rydan would witness most of Illiana’s loses as the practically point blank battles would interfere with command and control as well as adequate detection.
