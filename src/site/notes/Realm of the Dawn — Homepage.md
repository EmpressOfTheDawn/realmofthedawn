> “*Hark the laurels of eternal vict’ry,
> Daughter of dear liberty.
> Terra strikes forth in blazing glory,
> Uniting realm and humanity!*”
> $\quad$ — First verse of the Imperial anthem, *Ode to Empire*.

$\quad$ From the dark days of invasion that marked the turn of the millennia, to the current era of interstellar empire, Terra’s story had progressed far. Now she presides over a hundred stars and planets now fly her banner of imperial gold, purple, and white. The Imperium, and by extension Humanity, have suffered greatly during the centuries since ascending into the stars, but have also prospered just as greatly. 

$\quad$ Seeing into the future has never been a sure exercise but, any human and alien in the Orion Arm can wake up and know with certainty that the light of Sol will be shining for light years around.
