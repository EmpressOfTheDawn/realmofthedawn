  *It was September 2381 when the stars sang of a new war, though many thought to be a mere continuation of one ended decades ago. They would be shown how different it was to be.*
  
  *Two Empires, along with dozens of allied and client nations, would burn fires against each other so bright that the void of space was to be illuminated for 7 long years. It would see armadas to blot out the stars be sortied against each other. It would witness the Imperial notion of invincibility be shattered on the gate of the Imperium.  Yet in this theater of conflict, a legend would be born to whom the Gods of Victory and Peace would eventually follow.*
