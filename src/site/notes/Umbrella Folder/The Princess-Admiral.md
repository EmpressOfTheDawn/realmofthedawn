> “*The stars sing of glory and splendor to be won amidst the spoils of war. They have forgotten the cost of defeat and the sorrow of victory.*”
> $\quad$ — Admiral of the 11th Fleet, Hildegard Blackburn, c.2381.

 $\quad$ It was September 2381 when the silence of the void was shattered by an overture for a new war, one regarded by many as a mere continuation of one that ended decades ago. They were blind to how stark the contrast was to be.
  
 $\quad$ Across the breadth of a hundred light years, two empires along with dozens of allied and client nations would ignite the fires that would burn so bright that the dark of space was to be illuminated for 7 long years. It would see the greatest armadas ever sortied sent forth and be shattered. Armies would be landed on embattled planets and leave as prisoners of wars. Millions would heed the call of resistance and volunteerism. Millions would pay the price.
  
 $\quad$ The Imperium would win hard fought victories, and suffer harder fought defeats. Bastion. Rayonnement. Ptolemy. Charybdis. Orion. Star systems where Imperial power had been vested were swept beneath the tide of fury unleashed by the Holy Solar Empire. However, amidst the chaos of the early defensive campaigns, a name would stand out. Whose hair sparkled crimson, and whose eyes pierced the veil with boundless determination. Her career was to be like lightning, and her ascendancy would ensure her presence at the turning point of the nation’s fortune. The only child of the Blackburn family was to join the pantheon of military legend 
  
$\quad$ “*Nos proelio vincere aut temptatis mori.*”
